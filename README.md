# Constructing-Embodied-Differential-Equation-by-Sketching-in-a-Vector-Space

This repository contains a partial implementation of an interactive vector space designed to facilitate the representation of real-world dynamical systems through sketching. The projectâ€™s primary objective is to derive the governing differential equations of a dynamical system by analyzing the dynamics of sketched object attributes. The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (SINDy) model is employed to extract these dynamics, while the interface is deployed in a web environment using Flask. The vector interface is constructed utilizing Fabric.js, enabling intuitive and dynamic user interactions.

Note: This project is currently under active development, and additional features and improvements are forthcoming.

Key Features
- Vector Space Representation: The interactive interface allows users to sketch and manipulate objects in a vector space, representing elements of a real-world dynamical system. These sketched objects embody the attributes and behaviors that drive the underlying system dynamics.

- SINDy Model Integration: The project leverages the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (SINDy) model to identify and formulate the differential equations governing the sketched system's dynamics. This model efficiently captures the essential features of the system, enabling the derivation of compact and interpretable dynamical equations.

- Web Application Deployment: The interface is deployed as a web application using Flask, providing a platform-independent environment for users to interact with the vector space. The deployment facilitates accessibility and usability, allowing real-time manipulation and analysis of system dynamics from any web-enabled device.
